    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The paper describes a technique to structure datasets for analysis by making any variable for a data set as a column, any observation as a row, and groups of observations as a table together.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    It is meant to probing and analysis of data when first looked at, and to enable easy, effective use of different data analysis tools together. It also intends to accomplish standardardization of data cleaning so that anyone knows the steps involved.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "    For sentence one, the meaning that came across was that tidy datasets all have common structures that make them tidy, but every messy dataset has different characteristics that make it messy. For sentence two, what was conveyed was that while it is easy to identify characteristics that could be considered variables or observations, it is harder to actually decide whether those individual characteristics belong in the variable category or the observation category.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Values = a numerical or written quantity (normally numbers or strings)\n",
    "    Variables = any object with value(s) assigned to it that measure the same underlying attribute\n",
    "    Observation = any object with value(s) assigned to it that measure the same unit across attribute\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \"Tidy data is a standarized way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure\" where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. If this is not true then the data is not tidy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The five most common probles with messy datasets are as follows: 1) Column headers are values, not variable names, 2) Multiple variables are stored in one column, 3) Variables are stored in both rows and columns, 4) Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, 5) A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in table four is messy because religion is shown in the rows, income in the columns, and frequency in cells, when these variables should all be columns. Melting a database is turning columns into rows. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Table 11 is messy because there are a whole bunch of repeated values and because it has variables that are spread across multiple columns instead of one column. Table 12 is molten because while variables aren't spread across multiple columns, there are two variables in multiple rows: tmax and tmin.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The \"chicken-and-egg\" problems refers to the inextricable link between tidy tools and tidy data, because one is only as good as the other. In the future, Wichham hopes this leads to more and better tools and systems that can be used for data science.\n",
